# Cloud Storage Cross-Platform App with Flutter and Firebase

## Overview

In this project, I developed a robust cloud storage cross-platform application using Flutter and Dart. The app allows users to seamlessly upload and store a variety of multimedia files, including documents, videos, and images. The backend infrastructure and database were implemented using Firebase, ensuring secure and scalable storage solutions. To efficiently manage the app's state, I utilized the GetX state management library, optimizing performance and enhancing the user experience. This project not only honed my skills in Flutter development but also provided hands-on experience with cloud-based technologies and state-of-the-art app architecture.
